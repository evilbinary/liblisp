Description:
-----------
This ASDF installable package includes the SDL binaries for win32. The SDL binaries are 
distributed as a part of Lispbuilder as a convenience.

Please note that unlike Lispbuilder which uses the BSD license, the SDL library falls under the LGPL. 
Please see the included LGPL (in COPYING) for licensing information.

The source code for SDL can be retrieved from http://www.libsdl.org

SDL version 1.2.9 is included in this package. 
Sam Lantinga <slouken@libsdl.org> is the author of SDL.

Installation:
------------
The binary can be installed in two ways:
1) lispbuilder-sdl-binaries is an ASDF installable package. To install, simply:
	(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-binaries)

2) or, copy SDL.dll into a location on your HDD. 

As a default, the function that loads the SDL.dll will search 
"asdf:*central-registry*\site\lispbuilder-sdl-binaries\" for the binary. 

If (1) is used to install the binary then SDL.dll should be found and loaded automatically.
If (2) is used to install, then see the README in the lispbuilder-sdl package
for instructions on how to make CFFI load the binary from a specific location.
