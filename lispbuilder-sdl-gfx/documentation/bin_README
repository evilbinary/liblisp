Description:
-----------
This ASDF installable package includes the SDL_gfx binaries for win32. The SDL_gfx binaries are 
distributed as a part of Lispbuilder as a convenience (for Linux users) and as a Hail Mary (for Windows users) 
as this binary is a PITA to compile for the Win32 platform.

Please note that unlike Lispbuilder which uses the BSD license, the SDL_gfx library falls under the LGPL. 
Please see the included LGPL for licensing information.

The source code for SDL_gfx can be retrieved from http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/

SDL_gfx version 2.0.13 is included in this package. The author of SDL_gfx is 
Andreas Schiffler <aschiffler@appwares.com>

Installation:
------------
The binary can be installed in two ways:
1) lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-binaries is an ASDF installable package. To install, simply:
	(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx-binaries)

2) or, copy SDL_gfx.dll into a location on your HDD. 

As a default, the function that loads the SDL_gfx.dll will search 
"asdf:*central-registry*\site\lispbuilder-sdl-binaries\" for the binary. 

If (1) is used to install the binary then SDL_gfx.dll should be found and loaded automatically.
If (2) is used to install, then see the README in the lispbuilder-sdl-gfx package
for instructions on how to make CFFI load the binary from a specific location.

Compiling under Win32
---------------------
Frank Buss created the following make file that allows SDL_gfx to be compiled under Windows
using the MinGW compiler. The following should be placed into a makeFile 'Makefile'. The binary 
can then be built by calling make.

#------------------

CFLAGS = -O3 -DBUILD_DLL -DWIN32 -I/usr/local/include/SDL
LIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL

OBJS = SDL_framerate.o SDL_gfxPrimitives.o SDL_imageFilter.o SDL_rotozoom.o

IMPORT_LIB=libSDL_gfx.dll.a
SHARED_LIB=SDL_gfx.dll

all: $(SHARED_LIB)

$(SHARED_LIB): $(OBJS)
gcc -s -shared -o $@ \
$^ -Wl,--enable-auto-import,--export-all \
-Wl,--out-implib=$(IMPORT_LIB) \
$(LIBS)
